# Ruta 23
Ruta 23 is based on a typeface used on *colectivo* buses in Mexico City. A variety of typefaces can be found on different bus routes, as well as individual variations of these typefaces on specific vehicles.

This sample is from Route 23, making stops along Parque MÃ©xico.

## Design
The design is based fairly strictly on the original sample. Some minor modifications to the original design were made where they aid consistency in proportions, curves, or spacing.

## Working with the Glyphs file
The first release of Ruta 23 only includes the glyphs contained in the two original research images above.

It has been designed as an uppercase-only, nearly monospaced (the `1` is proportional) typeface.

There are several components available for use, as well.

Every side-bearing is set to `30 units` and is based on the `U`.
