# Ruta 23
Ruta 23 is based on a typeface used on *colectivo* buses in Mexico City. A variety of typefaces can be found on different bus routes, as well as individual variations of these typefaces on specific vehicles.

This sample is from Route 23, making stops along Parque M√©xico. Most vehicles (that I‚Äôve seen) along this route use a variations of this design.

## Design
The design is based directly on the original sample though some differences may be evident as the glyphs are redrawn (rather than traced). Minor modifications to the original design were made where they aid consistency in proportions, curves, or spacing.

## Working with the Glyphs file
The first release of Ruta 23 includes only the glyphs contained in the two original research images above.

There is no distinction between upper/lowercase in the original design and it has very little variation in width or kerning between glyphs. Hence, the font has been set up as uppercase-only and most glyphs in the initial set are a single width (the `1` is proportional).

There are several components available for use, as well.

Every side-bearing is set to `30 units` and is based on the `U`.
